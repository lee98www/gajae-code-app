# Self-hosting Gajae Code App

Gajae Code App is self-hosted from the **GitHub Releases** server artifact only:

<https://github.com/devswha/gajae-code-app/releases>

The canonical artifact is
`gajae-app-server-<version>-linux-x64-node22.tar.gz`, accompanied by an
artifact with the same name plus `.sha256`. Do not substitute a package
registry, container image, desktop delivery, or an unverified source build.

## Supported target and filesystem layout

The first supported artifact target is Linux on x86_64 with glibc 2.35 or
newer and a Node.js 22 runtime. It is a server artifact only.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.local/share/gajae-app` | Canonical Git checkout for source review and manual upstream intake. It is not a release payload. |
| `~/.gajae-app/releases/<version>` | Immutable unpacked server artifacts. |
| `~/.gajae-app/current` | Symlink to the release used by the service. |
| `~/.gajae-app/data` | Persistent application data, including user-managed database, assets, and cache paths. |
| `~/.config/systemd/user/gajae-app.service` | Per-user systemd service. |

A release deployment must never create, replace, or delete the checkout.
Likewise, replacing a release must not delete `~/.gajae-app/data`.

Before the first deployment, confirm the host contract:

```sh
test "$(uname -s)" = Linux
test "$(uname -m)" = x86_64
getconf GNU_LIBC_VERSION    # requires glibc 2.35 or newer
node --version              # requires v22
```

Use the release-install procedure in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to verify the
checksum, unpack a versioned release, install `gajae-app.service`, and activate
the initial `current` link.

## Service operations

Gajae Code App runs as the per-user `gajae-app.service`; root privileges and a
system-wide unit are not required.

```sh
systemctl --user status gajae-app.service
systemctl --user restart gajae-app.service
journalctl --user -u gajae-app.service -f
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:3001/health
```

Use `loginctl enable-linger "$USER"` only when the host policy permits the
service to continue after logout.

Keep the service on loopback unless remote access is deliberately required.
Prefer a trusted VPN or an SSH tunnel; do not expose the server by raw public
port forwarding.

```sh
ssh -N -L 3001:127.0.0.1:3001 user@server
```

## Herdr client boundary

When Herdr is installed for the same user, Gajae Code App can list admitted
current-user Herdr API sockets under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/herdr` or
`~/.config/herdr`, read selected-pane visible plain text, and send explicit
bounded input. Gajae Code App does not start, stop, upgrade, rename, focus, or
repair Herdr, and it does not migrate Herdr panes into SDK chat sessions.
Collie remains an independent client.

The browser never supplies a socket path. It selects an admitted session name
and pane id; the server resolves those through its own registry. Output reads
use Herdr `pane.read` with `source: "visible"` and `format: "text"` so routine
refreshes do not harvest scrollback or move the operator's terminal. Treat the
result as the current viewport, not conversation history.

Input is intentionally narrow: one-line text, Send + Enter, Enter-only, or
Escape. Text cannot contain control characters or newlines and is capped at
16 KiB. Gajae revalidates the observed pane before dispatch and serializes its
own same-pane submissions, but Herdr's public input request carries only
`pane_id`, `text`, and `keys`. That check is local preflight, not atomic
compare-and-send. A successful reply means Herdr accepted bytes; it does not
prove delivery, target continuity, or task completion. Timeouts after a write
may have happened are reported as unknown and are never retried automatically.

## Cutover to a verified release

A cutover changes only the `current` symlink and then restarts the service.
Download and checksum-verify the next artifact exactly as described in
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md); do not use a moving `latest` URL.

1. Record the active release before touching `current`.
2. Unpack the verified artifact into its new
   `~/.gajae-app/releases/<version>` directory.
3. Confirm that the expected server entry point is present.
4. Atomically replace `current`, restart the service, and check both systemd
   state and the health endpoint.
5. Keep the prior release directory until the new release is accepted.

```sh
RUNTIME="$HOME/.gajae-app"
VERSION=<approved-version>
RELEASE_DIR="$RUNTIME/releases/$VERSION"
PREVIOUS="$(readlink -f "$RUNTIME/current")"

test -f "$RELEASE_DIR/dist-server/server/index.js"
printf '%s\n' "$PREVIOUS" > "$RUNTIME/previous-release"
ln -s "$RELEASE_DIR" "$RUNTIME/current.next"
mv -Tf "$RUNTIME/current.next" "$RUNTIME/current"

systemctl --user restart gajae-app.service
systemctl --user --no-pager --full status gajae-app.service
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:3001/health
```

If the service or health check fails, perform the rollback immediately rather
than troubleshooting against a partially accepted release.

## Rollback

`previous-release` contains the release path captured by the cutover commands.
Validate it is an installed release before atomically restoring it.

```sh
RUNTIME="$HOME/.gajae-app"
PREVIOUS="$(<"$RUNTIME/previous-release")"

case "$PREVIOUS" in
  "$RUNTIME"/releases/*) ;;
  *) printf '%s\n' "Refusing an unsafe rollback target: $PREVIOUS" >&2; exit 1 ;;
esac
test -f "$PREVIOUS/dist-server/server/index.js"

ln -s "$PREVIOUS" "$RUNTIME/current.rollback"
mv -Tf "$RUNTIME/current.rollback" "$RUNTIME/current"
systemctl --user restart gajae-app.service
systemctl --user --no-pager --full status gajae-app.service
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:3001/health
```

Record the failed version and the rollback result in the deployment record.
Do not remove either release until the rollback health check succeeds.

## Removal boundary

To remove the service and release payload while preserving user data:

```sh
systemctl --user disable --now gajae-app.service
rm -f "$HOME/.config/systemd/user/gajae-app.service"
systemctl --user daemon-reload
rm -rf "$HOME/.gajae-app/releases"
rm -f "$HOME/.gajae-app/current" "$HOME/.gajae-app/previous-release"
```

This intentionally leaves `~/.gajae-app/data` and
`~/.local/share/gajae-app` untouched. Back up or remove either path only
through an explicit, separately reviewed data-retention decision.

## Source and upstream boundaries

The checkout at `~/.local/share/gajae-app` is for source review and deliberate
maintenance work. It is never the service working directory and is never
updated as part of a release cutover. Follow [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) for
manual, selective upstream intake; automated mirroring or synchronization is
not permitted.
