/**
 * The GJC engine's public surface.
 *
 * Everything else under `server/gjc-*` is the engine's inside. This file is the
 * only part of it the application is allowed to reach, and the list below is
 * therefore the entire contract between the two - a contract that has to survive
 * the engine moving to its own repository.
 *
 * It is deliberately small. Before this existed the application imported four
 * engine modules by path, which made every internal symbol look like part of the
 * interface and left nobody able to say what moving the engine would break. The
 * answer is this file.
 *
 * The fifth thing the application consumes is not importable: the worker is a
 * **process**, spawned by path from `gjc-worker-client.ts`, speaking the protocol
 * specified in `docs/GJC-WORKER-PROTOCOL.md`. That is the boundary that matters
 * most, and it is already the arm's-length one.
 *
 * Adding an export here is a decision about the engine's published API. Reaching
 * around it is a lint error.
